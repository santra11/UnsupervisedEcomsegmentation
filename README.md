# E-commerce Segmentation

Suppose I am a consultant for the Brazilian company "Olist," which provides sales solutions for online marketplaces. The company seeks to enhance its e-commerce team's daily communication campaigns through effective customer segmentation. In this project, I will apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as K-Means, K-Prototype, and DBSCAN, to cluster customer behavior based on their spending patterns.
